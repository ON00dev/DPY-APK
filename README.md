1. **Prepare your ingredients**:
   - An APK file.

   - Smali code will be extracted and optionally saved.

## Example Smali Code üìù

Here's a sneak peek of what Smali code looks like before it morphs into something greater:

```smali
.class public Lcom/example/MyClass;
.super Ljava/lang/Object;
.method public static myStaticMethod(I)V
    .locals 1
    const/4 v0, 0x1
    add-int/2addr v0, p0
